# MCP-Claude

## Overview
This repository demonstrates the integration capabilities between Claude AI and GitHub through Machine Control Protocol (MCP). It showcases how AI assistants can directly interact with GitHub repositories, helping developers automate tasks and streamline their workflow.

## Features

- **AI-Assisted Repository Management**: Examples of how Claude can create, modify, and manage GitHub repositories
- **Code Generation & Updates**: Demonstrates AI-powered code creation and modification
- **Documentation Automation**: Shows how AI can help maintain and update documentation
- **GitHub Operations Integration**: Examples of issue tracking, PR management, and other GitHub operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions
- Access to Claude AI with MCP capabilities

### Usage Examples

```python
# Example of a Python utility that could be developed in this repo
class GitHubAssistant:
    def __init__(self, repo_name):
        self.repo_name = repo_name
        
    def generate_documentation(self):
        # Code to analyze repository and generate documentation
        pass
        
    def suggest_improvements(self):
        # Code to analyze repository and suggest improvements
        pass
```
